                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>Forensic entomology is the scientific study of insects and their developmental stages to aid in
                    criminal investigations. It is primarily used to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI)—the time
                    that has elapsed since death—by analyzing the insects found on or around decomposing bodies. It also
                    provides evidence in cases involving abuse, neglect, and contamination.</p>

        <h1>Case Studies Associated with Forensically
            Important Entomofauna Recovered from
            Human Corpses from Punjab, India</h1>
        <h2> Anika Sharma, Madhu Bala* and Neha Singh</h2>
        <!-- <img src="/storypers.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> -->
        <p> <b>Introduction:</b>
            Forensic entomology is now-a-days considered an important
            branch of forensic science, in which the biology and ecology of
            insects are studied, particularly to determine the postmortem
            interval (PMI) [1]. The difficulties that forensic medical
            specialists have faced is regarding the determination of time
            since death during investigations if deceased is being killed for
            more than three days [2]. Postmortem interval can be calculated
            using developmental data of certain species of insects and also
            through analysis of the arthropod community composition and
            its succession on the corpse [1]. The succession based method
            requires knowledge of insect fauna in that particular geographical
            region where the corpse is found, since species and their times
            of colonization vary among bio-geographic regions [3-5]. Hence,
            composition of local carrion fauna, its seasonal variations and
            patterns of succession, as well as the periods of time each life
            stage spends on a cadaver, comprise crucial information to be
            used in forensic cases of a particular region [3,4,6].
            It is estimated that Diptera and Coleoptera account for
            60% of the fauna associated with decomposing carcasses
            and, because of that, they are indeed very important
            in forensic science [7]. Generally Diptera is associated
            with the early stages of decomposition while beetles
            are tend to be associated with the advanced stages of
            decomposition [8]. The arthropods comprise a major element
            of the carrion community [9-11]. Of the different groups of
            arthropod that have been categorized based on their attraction
            to the corpse in different stages of decomposition, four basic
            arthropods corpse relationships have generally been accepted:
            Necrophages e.g. blowflies, which feed and breed on the
            decomposing tissue of the carrion; Necrophiles e.g. beetles,
            which are predators and parasites of necrophagous fauna,
            feeding on other arthropods; Omnivores e.g. wasps and ants,
            which feed on the carrion and its colonizers and Opportunists
            e.g. spiders, which are found in and around the carrion but only
            use it as an extension of their own environment [11-13].
            Insects and humans are said to be most successful creature
            on earth. Firstly Blowflies visit corpse, followed by beetles and
            other insects. Knowing which insects are present, and which
            life stage they are in can determine how long ago a death
            took place. The use of insects in estimation of PMI requires
            information on their biology, phenology and habitat preferences.
            The main objective of insect succession studies is to examine
            the colonization patterns of insects in a particular area, often
            with the goal of obtaining data that can be applied to forensic investigations involving insects in the
            event that a death occurs
            in a similar environment. <br><br>
            <b>Insects Silently Give us Valuable Information about a Crime:</b>
            The experts at the American Board of Forensic Entomology 
            say we should be listening to insects through the evidence they 
            provide us. But it is not only the time of death estimation that 
            insects can help in criminal investigation. They can also helps us 
            to discover the site of crime and how it was committed. They can 
            shed light on crimes involving the smuggling of drugs; they can 
            lead us to home town of a murder victim. Curiously, the use of 
            insect in crime investigation is relatively new subject. It began to 
            take shape during the second half of the 19th century, but even 
            today, very few people, including some police officers, know that 
            it exists at all.
        </p><br>
        <p> <b>Case 1: Corpse Found from Residential Area:</b>
            On March 30th, 2015, the body of 40 years old male, in the 
           bloated stage of decomposition was recovered from a residential 
           area of distt. Ludhiana, Punjab (India). The body of the deceased 
           was discolored, facial features were hardly recognizable and 
           genitals were fully decomposed as the genitals were chopped 
           off. Forensic examination found incised wounds 8×1cm deep on 
           the left side of the neck and another wound 15×12cm present 
           between the legs. The death was attributed to murder by multiple 
           stabbing. Entomofauna found on the body were maggots and 
           pupae of Chrysomya megacephala  </p>
           <img src="/entocase1.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
           <br>
        <p><b> Case 2: Diptera and Coleoptera on Skeletonized Body:</b> 
            A partially mummified body of a 26 years old male was found 
            from his residence at Patiala, Punjab (India) on 22nd April, 2015. 
            Body was in livor mortis stage. In this stage blood appears on the 
            skin as purplish-red discoloration (like a bruise) and can give 
            indication of position of the body at the time of death. The body 
            was partially skeletonized in the neck region and upper chest 
            002
             where underlying bones were fully exposed. Facial features were 
            unidentifiable, soft tissue including the skin is missing from the 
            right side of face, head, neck and upper part of chest.  Cause of 
            death was unknown. Entomofauna found on the corpse consists 
            of different instars of larvae of Chrysomya rufifacies and beetles 
            belonging to family Dermestidae and Cleridae i.e Dermestes 
            maculatus and Necrobia rufipes <br>
            <img src="/entocase2.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <p><b> Case 3: Drowning Case:</b>
                A dead body of about 52 years old female was recovered 
               from Bhakra canal, Patiala, Punjab (India) on 22nd April, 2015. 
               The body was in bloating stage of decomposition with partially 
               identifiable facial features. Body was emitting foul smell. Whole 
               body was inflated with water, as muddy water was present in 
               larynx, trachea and stomach which was reported during post
               mortem examination. Peeling of skin was reported on abdomen 
               and limbs. Egg batches and adults of Chrysomya megacephala 
               were present all over the body. Beetles belonging to family 
               Histeridae were reported on corpse. Later egg batches were 
               transferred to rearing jar provided with a piece of goat meat as 
               rearing medium. Rearing helps in identification of fly as well as 
               calculation of PMI  <br>
