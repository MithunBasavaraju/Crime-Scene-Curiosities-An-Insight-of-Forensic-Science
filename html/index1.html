              <h2>Overview:</h2>
              <p>Trace Evidence refers to any small, often microscopic materials that are transferred between individuals, objects, or locations during a criminal act. These materials, which can be too small to see without magnification, play a critical role in forensic investigations by linking a suspect to a crime scene, a victim, or a particular object.

                The term "trace" reflects the minute size of the evidence. Despite its small size, trace evidence can be crucial in establishing the facts surrounding a crime and can be more reliable than more substantial forms of evidence.</p>

            <h1>Trace Evidence – How Fibers and Hair are used to aid in Crime Solving</h1>
            <h2>Fibers – how are they used in court cases?</h2>
            <img src="/storypers.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <p>Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, Army captain and Green Beret accused 
                 of murdering his pregnant wife and two children in 1970, he was made famous in the book and 
                    subsequent made for TV movie “Fatal Vision”.  The investigators were suspicious of the doctor 
                    because of the nature of his wounds – suggesting that they were not defensive and perhaps even 
                    self inflicted.  Blue threads that matched the doctor’s pajama top were found under the body of his 
                    wife as well as in the bedroom of both murdered children and even under the fingernails of one of 
                    his daughters.  When MacDonald was confronted with this and other evidence he reportedly stated 
                    “You guys are more thorough than I thought”.  Dr. MacDonald is currently in prison and still 
                    maintains his innocence. 
                    Fiber background: 
                    There are two general types of fibers, natural and manufactured.  Natural fibers have been utilized 
                    by humans for centuries and are derived from plants and animals.  The first manufactured fiber 
                    (Rayon – 1911) brought about a great revolution in the variety of fibers available and they have 
                    continued to replaced natural fibers over the years.  See the table below for several examples of 
                    each type. Many of these manufactured fibers are actually synthesized from chemicals that have been joined 
                    together in long chains called polymers.  The chemicals that the polymers are made from are 
                    called monomers.  A polymer can be thought of as a long chain made out of repeating monomers. 
            </p>
            <img src="/storytable.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <p>Seen below is the monomer of cellulose called glucose.  The diagram shows two polymers that 
                        glucose can form. Starch is the plant storage form of sugar and what we eat when we enjoy our 
                        potatoes! Cellulose is a slightly different organization of the glucose monomers (note the bond 
                        angle of the oxygen that connects the glucose rings) and makes a very different polymer.

           <p><b>Ways to categorize fibers for identification: </b><br>
                            There are many ways to identify fibers and we will study how scientists use the following 
                            techniques; microscopic analysis, burn testing and solubility, polarizing of light under a microscope 
                            and molecule polarity. <br>  
                            <b>Hair -  How is it used in court cases? </b><br>
                            In the case described above about Jeffrey MacDonald, the defendant and his lawyer had appealed 
                            for a new trial as recently as December of 2005 based on hair evidence.  From an interview on 
                            Good Morning America
                             , "We expect that some of the hairs found at the crime scene will not 
                            match the MacDonald family member," attorney Andrew Good said. "And will therefore be 
                            evidence of intruders."  Ultimately, the Supreme Court denied the petition for a new trial, finding 
                            no compelling evidence showing the presence of intruders in the family home. <br>
                            <b>Another case that also shows the importance of hair evidence: </b><br> A woman was murdered in an alley 
                            and next to her was a large flower box with liner.  The flower box was analyzed and found to 
                            contain tan and navy blue wool fibers and a red acrylic fiber.  The woman’s clothing was a tan 
                            wool coat, navy wool/polyester blend socks and a red acrylic sweater.  The flower box was now 
                            definitely linked to the victim.  Additionally, light blue nylon fibers and rabbit hair was also found 
                            on the flower box as well as the victim’s wool coat.  Neither of these fibers could be accounted for 
                            with her clothing or home.  When other evidence led the police to a man who had just sold a full – 
                            length rabbit fur coat, a warrant was obtained for his home which contained a light blue nylon rug.  
                            The suspect was now tied to the victim and the flower box (part of the murder) due to the 
                            presence of the rabbit hair and blue nylon fiber, and was found guilty at trial.
