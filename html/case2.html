        <h2>1. The Yorkshire Ripper: what did he do and when? A timeline (1969)</h2>
        <p>From 1969 to 1980, Peter Sutcliffe attacked numerous women, as recounted in current ITV drama The Long Shadow. How did he get away with it?</p>
        <img src="/case2(1.1).png" alt="">
        <p>Over the course of five years in the 1970s, serial killer Peter Sutcliffe brutally murdered 13 women, injuring at least seven more, across the north of England.
            Now, the terrible story of what he did, and how he was finally caught, has been made into a true crime drama series on ITV. Titled The Long Shadow, it examines how Sutcliffe managed to get away with the killings for so long, and how the police managed to miss him so many times before he was eventually caught.</p>
        <p>This is a comprehensive breakdown of what happened, and when.</p>
        <h3>Before 1975</h3>
        <p>Born in 1946 to a working class family in Bingley, Sutcliffe had a troubled home life: his mother, Kathleen, was regularly abused by his father, John, who was also an alcoholic. As a result, Sutcliffe idolised his mother – and was branded by John as “a wimp, always hanging from his mother’s apron, a mummy’s boy.”
            Sutcliffe was tormented at home, and when he joined St. Joseph’s Catholic Primary School, relentlessly bullied. With several siblings and his abusive father crammed into a small working-class house, his home life was also chaotic. In his early twenties John posed as his mother’s lover, luring her to a hotel to expose her infidelity to her children (two of whom, including Peter, he brought with him). This seems to have been a formative moment in Sutcliffe’s life – indeed, his father later said he “had a look on his face, like an animal, it were. I think it may have turned his mind.</p>
        <p>Clearly, this had a huge psychological impact on Sutcliffe. He left school at 15 and began a series of menial jobs, including as a lorry driver and as a gravedigger at Bingley Cemetery in 1960 – something his colleagues reported he enjoyed a bit too much, even volunteering to wash corpses as overtime. However, he didn’t stay there: after drifting from job to job, he eventually trained as an HGV driver in 1975, when he was 29.
            In his late adolescence, he began to develop a penchant for voyeurism, spying on sex workers between his shift work, and using their other services frequently. Despite this, he did get married in 1974 – to Sonia Szurma, the daughter of Czech immigrants, whom he met in 1967. Sonia was studying to become a primary school teacher when they met; shortly afterwards, she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. She would often be subject to fits of rage and would treat Sutcliffe “like a naughty schoolboy.”</p>
        <p>His first documented assault on a female sex worker took place a full six years before he started his killing spree when he was 23. He had been searching for another woman who he claimed had cheated him out of money, but hadn’t managed to find her at the time of the attack. Instead, he seems to have taken his anger out on another woman: at the time, Sutcliffe was in the van of his friend Trevor Birdsall, but got out of the car when he saw her. He then hit her across the back of the head with a stone in a sock.</p>
        <h3>1975</h3>
        <img src="/case2(1.2).png" alt="">
        <p>This seems to have been the year that Sutcliffe’s (by then aged 29) violence against women escalated. The first of his victims was 36-year-old Woolworths worker Anna Rogulskyj, who was attacked on July 5, 1975 in Keighley, as she walked home alone.
            Sutcliffe hit her with a hammer and slashed her with a knife, but left without killing her after he was disturbed. A passerby found her bleeding in the street; Rogulskyj underwent emergency brain surgery and ultimately survived.</p>
        <p>"I’ve been afraid to go out much because I feel people are staring and pointing at me,” she said later. “The whole thing is making my life a misery. I sometimes wish I had died in the attack."
            A few weeks later, on August 15, Sutcliffe attacked Olive Smelt in Halifax, after distracting her with small talk about the weather. He struck 41-year-old Smelt from behind with a hammer and slashed across her lower back with a knife, but again Sutcliffe was interrupted before he could kill her. Though Smelt gave evidence to the police – including the detail that her attacker had a Yorkshire accent – this was ignored.                
            On August 27, Sutcliffe struck again, attacking 14-year-old Tracy Browne in Silsden as she walked down a country lane. She was struck on the head five times before a passing car spooked Sutcliffe and he ran off; Browne survived after emergency brain surgery. She later said that she had walked with Sutcliffe for half a mile before he struck “for about 30 minutes and I never once felt intimidated or in danger.”</p>
        <h3>1976</h3>   
        <img src="/case2(1.3).png" alt="">     
        <p>Sutcliffe struck again at the start of January, when he murdered 42-year-old Emily Monica Jackson: the story that forms the main plot for much of the ITV show The Long Shadow. Jackson (played by Katherine Kelly), a mother of three, had turned to sex work to earn money for the family: her husband Sydney (played expertly by Daniel Mays) owned a failing roofing business.
            The pair of them had developed a technique for soliciting: Emily would drive them to the nearest pub, where Sydney would wait for her to finish working, and they would drive back together. However, on January 20, Sutcliffe picked up Jackson outside the Gaiety pub. He pretended his car had broken down, and as Jackson peered over the engine, he hit her over the back of the head.</p>
        <p>Her body was discovered in an alleyway the following morning, 800 yards from the Gaiety; her purse was lying on the ground next to her and her top had been pushed up. She had been stabbed 51 times with a sharpened screwdriver; Sutcliffe had also stamped on her thigh, leaving an impression of his shoe, which was later identified as a Dunlop Warwick work boot, probably in a size 7. The police also found a similar boot print nearby, but ultimately the trail on this led nowhere (in one interview, Sutcliffe was wearing those very same boots as the police showed him pictures of the murder scene and the footprints he had left with them).
            A few months later, Sutcliffe targeted 20-year-old Marcella Claxton as she walked home from a house party in Leeds. She accepted Sutcliffe’s offer of a lift as he drove past. When she got out of the car to urinate, he hit her from behind with a hammer. Claxton suffered traumatic injuries to her head and crawled away into a phone box; she was also four months pregnant and miscarried her child. She managed to phone for help and hid in the phone box as Sutcliffe came back to check on her.</p>
        <h3>1977</h3>
        <p>By 1977, the moniker ‘Yorkshire Ripper’ had been firmly established, but the police still hadn’t managed to track Sutcliffe down. He took full advantage of the itinerant lifestyle demanded by his job as a HGV driver, which took him all over the North: on February 5, 28-year-old sex worker Irene Richardson was attacked after leaving a rooming house in Leeds. She had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer and stabbed in the stomach; after she had died, Sutcliffe continued to mutilate her.</p>
        <img src="/case2(1.4).png" alt="">
        <p>Richardson’s body was found near some tyre tracks, presumably from Sutcliffe’s car – but despite pulling together a list of suspected cars, this also resulted in a dead end.
            On April 23, he struck again, killing 32-year-old Patricia Atkinson-Mitra in her Bradford flat. The police found another bootprint on the bedclothes, but again, this was never traced – and in the meantime, Sutcliffe went onto murder Jayne MacDonald on June 25.            
            The teenager was walking back from seeing friends in Leeds after missing the last bus home, when she was attacked at around 2am. Her body was found by children in a nearby playground next day in Chapeltown; according to the Home Office pathologist who examined her, she had been hit with the hammer and had a broken bottle embedded in her chest.</p>
        <p>The following month, on July 10, 43-year-old Maureen Long narrowly escaped Sutcliffe as she left a nightclub in Bradford. He offered her a lift home, and as she stopped to urinate, he stuck her on the head, knocking her out and leaving her with hypothermia. She was in hospital for nine weeks, and though there were witnesses, they misidentified Sutcliffe’s car, resulting in weeks of fruitless police investigations.
            However, the police’s biggest missed opportunity came on October 9, when sex worker Jean Jordan was found dead on an allotment by dairy worker Bruce Jones. She had been picked up by Sutcliffe on October 1 in Manchester; he gave her a £5 note before hitting her on the head and killing her. After dumping her body, Sutcliffe said in his confession that he realised the note he’d given her was traceable. He revisited her body, but failed to find it – Jordan had hidden it in a secret compartment in her handbag.</p>
        <img src="/case2(1.5).png" alt="">
        <h3>1978</h3>
        <p>In January 1978, the police finally closed the case on the issue of the £5 note. Though Sutcliffe had been pulled in for questioning several times (and contacted by the police squad a few more times) he was not considered suspicious enough to be worth investigating.
            A few weeks later, on January 21, he killed 21-year-old sex worker Yvonne Pearson in Bradford, bludgeoning her with a hammer then stuffing horsehair from a nearby sofa into her mouth and dumping her body by Lumb Lane. Ten days later, he attacked 18-year-old Elena Rytka in Huddersfield, stripping most of the clothes from her dead body and stabbing her in the chest – speaking after his capture, Sutcliffe said that at this point, "I had the urge to kill any woman. The urge inside me to kill girls was now practically uncontrollable.”</p>
        <p>After this, on May 16, he killed Vera Millward. She had told her boyfriend she was going out to buy cigarettes, but instead was picked up by Sutcliffe and bludgeoned as she got out of his car; after she died, he dragged her body over to a fence and stabbed her repeatedly.</p>
        <h3>1979</h3> 
        <p>After going quiet for almost a year, Sutcliffe struck again on April 4, killing Josephine Whitaker, a 19-year-old clerk as she walked home from her job in Halifax. He stabbed her 21 times with a screwdriver in the chest and stomach, and hit her so hard across the head that her skull was fractured.
            Though there was forensic evidence for this, the police were distracted by the sudden appearance of a hoax tape message, pretending to be from the Ripper. "I’m Jack. I see you’re having no luck catching me,” the message went. “I have the greatest respect for you, George [Oldfield, in charge of the investigation], but Lord, you’re no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started.” This was accompanied by two letters to police and the Daily Mirror in March, signed “Jack the Ripper”.</p>   
        <p>This derailed the Sutcliffe investigation for months – though Sutcliffe was interviewed twice more in 1979. The hoaxer himself wasn’t discovered until 2005 - and in the meantime, Sutcliffe killed another woman: Babs Leach, a student at Bradford University, whose body was dumped in a back street under a pile of bricks.</p>
        <h3>1980</h3>
        <img src="/case2(1.6).png" alt="">
        <p>1980 marked another year of missed chances for the West Yorkshire Police. In April, Sutcliffe was arrested for drunk driving, but was released on bail; before his trial, he attacked and killed civil servant Marguerite Walls on August 20 as she walked to her home in Farnsley. He hit her over the head with a hammer repeatedly.
            In an attempt to move her from the place of her attack – a driveway – to a more secluded garden, he tied a length of rope around her neck and strangled her with it; once she was dead, he removed all of her clothes, leaving just her tights.</p>
        <p>In the next few months, he went onto attack doctor Upadhya Bandara on September 24 and Maureen Lea, an art student at Leeds, in his old hunting ground of Chapeltown on October 25. Both women survived, though Lea was left with serious wounds, including a punctured hole to the back of her skull and a severed spinal cord.
            A month later, he went after 16-year-old Theresa Sykes as she walked to the shops in Huddersfield on November 5; he hit her across the back of the head, but Sykes’ boyfriend heard her screaming and his appearance scared him off. She subsequently had to undergo surgery – from which she was still recovering when Sutcliffe was arrested.</p>

        <h2>2. The 'Golden State Killer': Inside the timeline of crimes (1970)</h2>
        <p>The "Golden State Killer" crimes date back to the 1970s.</p>
        <p>The notorious "Golden State Killer" was behind serial rapes and murders across California in the 1970s and 1980s -- but decades passed before a suspect was identified.
            In 2018, Joseph DeAngelo was arrested. This summer, the 74-year-old former police officer pleaded guilty to 13 counts of first-degree murder. And in August, he was confronted by his victims and their family members in court.</p>
        <p>Here's a look back at the case:</p>
        <h3>1973-1976</h3>
        <p>From 1973 to 1976, DeAngelo was a police officer in Exeter, California, officials said.</p>
        <h3>1975</h3>
        <p>On Sept. 11, 1975, DeAngelo, while serving as a police officer, shot and killed professor Claude Snelling in front of his daughter at his Visalia, California, home, according to prosecutors.
            DeAngelo kicked the daughter three times in the face and then fled, prosecutors said.            
            Visalia is 10 miles away from Exeter.</p>
        <h3>1976-1979</h3>
        <p>DeAngelo served as a police officer in Auburn, California, from 1976 to 1979.</p>
        <img src="/case2(2.1).png" alt="">
        <p>He was fired for allegedly stealing a hammer and a can of dog repellent, The Associated Press reported, citing Auburn Journal articles from the time.</p>
        <h3>1976-1978</h3>
        <p>In the summer of 1976, burglaries and rapes terrorized the eastern district of Sacramento County.</p>
        <img src="/case2(2.2).png" alt="">
        <p>The "Golden State Killer" would break into his victims' homes by prying open a window or door while they slept, the FBI said.
            Sometimes he would take jewelry, identification, cash and coins from the victims' homes.</p>
        <img src="/case2(2.3).png" alt="">
        <h3>1978-1981</h3>
        <p>In February 1978, the "Golden State Killer" shot and killed Brian and Katie Maggiore, who were walking their dog in the Sacramento area.
            After Brian Maggiore was shot, Katie Maggiore ran away and yelled for help, but DeAngelo caught up with her and shot her in the head, prosecutors said.</p>
        <img src="/case2(2.4).png" alt="">
        <p>The burglaries continued in the East Bay area of Northern California, and then escalated into rapes and murders along the California coast, the FBI said.
            The "Golden State Killer" would often "attack couples, tie up both victims, rape the female, and then murder them," according to the FBI.            
            On Dec. 30, 1979, Debra Manning and Robert Offerman were killed in Goleta, near Santa Barbara.</p>
        <img src="/case2(2.5).jpg" alt="">
        <img src="/case2(2.6).jpg" alt="">
        <p>Lyman and Charlene Smith were murdered in their Ventura home in March 1980. Charlene Smith was bound and raped, prosecutors said.
            The couple was later found dead by Lyman Smith's 12-year-old son, prosecutors said.            
            In August of 1980, Keith and Patrice Harrington were slain in their home in Dana Point in Southern California.           
            On Feb. 5, 1981, 28-year-old Manuela Witthuhn was bound, raped and bludgeoned to death while home alone in Irvine in Southern California. Her body was found by her mother, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>In July 1981, Cheri Domingo and Gregory Sanchez were killed in Goleta.
            Sanchez was shot and then beaten to death, bludgeoned in the head two dozen times, prosecutors said.            
            DeAngelo then bound Domingo, raped her and beat her in the head more than 10 times, prosecutors said.</p>
        <h3>1986</h3>
        <p>No crimes were attributed to the "Golden State Killer" from July 1981 until May 1986, when 18-year-old Janelle Cruz was killed. Cruz was bound, raped and bludgeoned in the face and head at her home, prosecutors said.
            That was his last known crime.</p>
        <img src="/case2(2.7).png" alt="">
        <h3>2018</h3>
        <p>The case went cold for decades.
            DeAngelo's name came up for the first time in the investigation in 2018, Sacramento District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said.</p>
        <img src="/case2(2.8).jpg" alt=""> 
        <p>DeAngelo became the first public arrest obtained through genetic genealogy, a new technique that takes the DNA of an unknown suspect left behind at a crime scene and identifies him or her by tracing a family tree through his or her family members, who voluntarily submit their DNA to public genealogy databases.
            To identify DeAngelo, investigators narrowed the family tree search based on age, location and other characteristics.            
            Once authorities zeroed in on DeAngelo, they surveilled him and collected his DNA from a tissue left in a trash.
            Investigators plugged his discarded DNA back into the genealogy database and found a match, linking DeAngelo's DNA to DNA found at crime scenes, prosecutors said.           
            He was arrested in April 2018 in Sacramento County.            
            After DeAngelo was taken into custody, he said to himself in an interview room, "I did all those things. I destroyed all those lives," prosecutors said in court during the guilty plea.</p>
        <h3>2020</h3>
        <p>On June 29, 2020, DeAngelo pleaded guilty to 13 counts of first-degree murder. The plea deal also required DeAngelo to admit to multiple uncharged acts, including rapes, which were described in horrific detail by prosecutors.
            The death penalty was taken off the table and he will serve life without parole, prosecutors said.</p>   
        <img src="/case2(2.9).png" alt="">
        <p>From Aug. 18, 2020, to Aug. 20, 2020, DeAngelo was confronted in court by rape survivors, their relatives, and the relatives of those he had killed.
            Survivor after survivor told stories of fear, grief and resilience.
            Jane Carson-Sandler, who was raped in 1976 while home with her son, told the court, "I was frozen in fear beyond description. ... My attention was not on the rape, but fully on where did you put my son when you removed him from the bed? Where did you put him and what were you going to do to him?"</p>   
        <img src="/case2(2.10).png" alt="">  
        <p>DeAngelo, who had sat in a wheelchair and was covered by a white face mask as victims and family members gave statements, rose out of the wheelchair and spoke free of the face covering.
            "I've listened to all your statements. Each one of them," DeAngelo said in court. "And I'm truly sorry to everyone I have hurt. Thank you, your honor."</p>
