        <h2>1. ATKID: The Atlanta Child Murders Case (1979-2004)</h2>
        <img src="/case3(1).png" alt="">
        <p> When the first murder associated with the Atlanta Child Murders case 
            occurred in July 1979, it made little impact on the news cycle of the bustling city 
            known as the Hub of the South. By the time the body of the last victim was found 
            in late May 1981, news about the case dominated not only local headlines but 
            international headlines as well. Someone was killing Atlanta’s African American 
            youth.Fourteen-year-old Edward Hope Smith had been missing for one week when 
            his body was found on July 28, 1979 in a vacant lot in southeast Atlanta. He had 
            been shot. On that same day, the body of a 13-year-old, Alfred James Evans, was 
            found near Smith’s body. He had last been seen three days before, and had been 
            strangled.  </p>
            <p>Milton Harvey, age fourteen, was last seen riding a yellow bicycle on 
                September 4, 1979. His body was found on November 16, 1979. An autopsy 
                report concluded his was an undetermined cause of death (UCD). The next 
                victim was Yusef Ali Bell, age nine, who was last seen on October 21, 1979. His 
                body was found later that same day in a vacant school; the cause of death was 
                strangulation. 
                Following a more than four-month lull without a suspicious death of any 
                of Atlanta’s children, the murders began again with the killing of Angel Lanier, 
                age 12, the first female victim. She was last seen at school on March 4, 1980. Her 
                remains were found March 10, 1980, and strangulation was once again the cause 
                of death. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="hero2">
            <img src="/case3(2).png" alt="" >
            <p>Angel’s murder was followed by the murders of:
                Jeffrey L. Mathis, age 10, was last seen March 11, 1980, and was found on 
               February 13, 1981; UCD. Eric Middlebrooks, age 14, was last seen on May 18, 
               1980, and was found on May 19, 1980; head injury. Christopher Richardson, 
               age 12, last seen on June 9, 1980 was found on January 9, 1981; UCD. Latonya 
               Wilson, age 7, taken from her bedroom June 22, 1980, was found on October 
               18, 1980; UCD. Aaron D. Wyche, age 10, was last seen on June 23, 1980, and was found on June 24, 1980; Asphyxiation. Anthony Bernard 
               Carter, age 9, was last seen on July 7, 1980, and his body 
               was found on July 7, 1980; he had been stabbed. Earl Lee 
               Terrell, age 10, was last seen on July 31, 1980, and was 
               found on January 9, 1981; UCD.
                By the end of July 1980, at least 12 of Atlanta’s 
               children had been murdered, with their cases unresolved. 
               Most of the bodies had been found outdoors, either in 
               vacant lots, the woods, or behind houses and buildings. 
               One theory was that the murders had been committed 
               by the same person or persons. Another theory was that 
               many of the victims were runaways or young hustlers who 
               risked their lives every day by roaming the streets of the 
               city.</p>
               <p> The growing number of unsolved child murders
               prompted the Atlanta Police Department (APD) to form a task 
               force in early summer 1980 with Agents from the Georgia Bureau of 
               Investigation and detectives from other area police departments. In 
               response to requests from city officials, Atlanta SAC John D. Glover 
               offered whatever assistance the Bureau could provide, but stopped 
               short of opening a federal case without a strong indication of a 
               federal violation. Two FBI Special Agents were appointed to serve as 
               liaison between the task force and the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit, 
               the FBI Laboratory and for out-of-state investigative leads.
                On August 20, 1980, Clifford Jones, age 13, disappeared. His 
               body was found the next day; he had been strangled. The next victim 
               was Darren Glass, age 11, who was last seen on September 14, 1980. 
               His body was never found but his disappearance would subsequently 
               provide part of a federal nexus for the FBI to open a kidnapping case 
               under the presumption Darren could have been transported across 
               state lines after the first 24 hours had passed. 
               The next victims were Charles Stephens, age 12, who was last 
               seen on October 9, 1980, and whose body was found on October 
               10, 1980, and Aaron Jackson, age 9, who was last seen on November 1, 1980. Aaron’s remains were found on the banks of Atlanta’s 
               Chattahoochee River on November 2, 1980, the first victim to be found in or near a body of water. Charles had been strangled and Aaron 
               had been asphyxiated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hero3">
            <img src="/case3(3).png" alt="">
               <p> Several pieces of evidence from the crime scenes were common denominators. Green nylon carpet fibers and dog hairs were found 
                on many of the bodies that had been found on dry land. At some point, presumably in October 1980, information about the carpet 
                fibers and dog hairs was “leaked” to the Atlanta Journal Constitution which wasted no time in publishing it. Soon the pattern of disposal 
                changed, and bodies were instead dumped unceremoniously near or into either the Chattahoochee River or the South River.
                 On November 6, 1980, two days after the presidential election which Georgia native Jimmy Carter lost, Attorney General Benjamin 
                Civiletti directed the FBI to open a preliminary investigation. At that point, four African American children were still missing. On 
                November 17, the major case investigation known as “ATKID” was officially opened.
                 The Bureau mandate was to conduct an independent investigation, while 
                simultaneously assisting the local task force with manpower, guidance and 
                technical assistance. First Office Special Agents in Atlanta were given an option 
                to delay transfer to their second office assignment, and veteran Agents from 
                eastern field offices, particularly those with homicide investigative backgrounds, 
                were brought in on temporary duty to assist in the investigation. 
                The first round of temporary duty (TDY) Agents reported to Atlanta on 
                November 17, 1980, just one week after 16-year-old Patrick Rogers was last seen 
                on November 10, 1980. His remains were found on December 7, 1980 on the 
                banks of the Chattahoochee River. The cause of death was blunt force trauma. 
                The next few weeks of the holiday season were quiet with no children 
                reported missing. However, at the beginning of the new year, 14-year-old 
                Lubie Geter disappeared, having last been seen January 3, 1981. He was found 
                on February 5, 1981; the cause of death was strangulation. Terry Pue, age 15, 
                disappeared on January 22, 1981 and was found the next day, strangled to death 
                in nearby Rockdale County.</p>
                <p> FBI profiler Roy Hazelwood from the Behavioral Science Unit at Quantico 
                    f
                     lew to Atlanta in mid-1980 to consult on the murders to date. He was followed 
                    some months later by FBI profiler John Douglas who arrived in Atlanta in early 
                    January 1981 to develop a formal profile of the person or persons responsible for 
                    the child murders. 
                    Police Captain at the missing persons offices with images of 
                    missing people behind him, 1981; contributor Dwight Ross, Jr.
                     AJCP165-016g.tif, Atlanta Journal-Constitution Photographic 
                    Archives. Special Collections and Archives, Georgia State 
                    University Library
                     Douglas walked the woods in south Atlanta, where five of the children’s bodies had been found, and reviewed the case files. He also 
                    relied on assessments from interviews previously conducted by his unit with 25 serial and mass murderers. One key element of Douglas’ 
                    profile was that the killer was most likely an African American, under the presumption that a white person could not easily travel in black 
                    neighborhoods without creating a great deal of suspicion. This element was part of the profile despite the fact that a serial killer who was 
                    African American would be unusual.
                     Douglas characterized the individual as being of average or above average intelligence, articulate, and probably presenting himself 
                    publicly as a figure of authority. The person would be closely following the media coverage of the murders, and had probably had frequent changes in employment or was self-employed. 
                    Other resources dedicated to the case included hypnosis experts, search dogs, polygraphers, and fingerprint examiners. Larry 
                    Peterson from the Georgia State Crime Lab and expert examiners from the FBI Laboratory’s Microscopic Analysis Unit, led by Harold 
                    “Hal” Deadman, spent countless hours working on the fibers and dog hairs collected in the case.
                     Meanwhile, the murders continued. Patrick Baltazar, age 12, was last seen near a phone booth with a friend on February 6, 1981. His 
                    body was found on February 13, 1981; he had been strangled. Curtis Walker, age 13, was last seen on February 19, 1981, and was found 
                    strangled on March 6, 1981 in the Chattahoochee River. Joseph “JoJo” Bell, age 15, was last seen on March 2, 1981. His body was found on 
                    April 19, 1981 in the South River in Rockdale County. Thirteen-year-old Timothy Hill was last seen March 11, 1981 and his remains were 
                    found on March 30, 1981 in the Chattahoochee; the cause of death was asphyxiation.
                     On February 11, 1981, one young boy was kidnapped from Atlanta’s streets and thrown in the back of a car. He managed to escape 
                    when the vehicle stopped for a red light, and would later provide identifying information which matched much of that of the suspect who 
                    was eventually charged with two of the murders. </p>

                    <img src="/case3(4).png" alt="">
                    <p>An article appeared in an Atlanta newspaper in February 1981 regarding fibers being found on the bodies retrieved from the rivers. 
                        Soon thereafter, the bodies that were recovered from the water were either nude or semi-nude.
                         In March 1981, African American boys enrolled in grades four through ten in Atlanta area schools received an FBI questionnaire 
                        asking about any suspicious encounters with 
                        strangers they might have had in the recent past. 
                        Sixteen hundred questionnaires were returned with 
                        977 containing sufficient information to warrant a 
                        follow-up interview.
                         With the entire metropolitan Atlanta area on 
                        edge, city officials established a curfew of 7:00 p.m.- 
                        6:00 a.m., seven nights a week, in an effort to get 
                        youngsters off the streets after sundown. The curfew 
                        did not apply to youths aged 17 and older and soon 
                        young black adult men of small stature became 
                        unsuspecting victims. 
                        T
                         hus, the next murder victims were: 
                        Eddie Duncan, age 20, was last seen on March 
                        20, 1981, and was found in the Chattahoochee River 
                        on March 31, 1981, UCD. Larry Rogers, age 20, last 
                        seen March 30, 1981, was found in an apartment on 
                        April 9, 1981; he was strangled. Michael McIntosh, 
                        age 23, last seen on April 1, 1981, was found in the 
                        South River on April 20, 1981, asphyxiation.
                         John Harold Porter, age 28, was found stabbed 
                        to death in a vacant lot on April 12, 1981. (Although 
                        fibers were found on Porter’s body, officials were 
                        hesitant to include his name on the list of victims.) 
                        Jimmy Ray Payne, age 21, who was last seen on April 22, 1981, was found in the Chattahoochee River on April 27, 1981; UCD. William 
                        Barrett, age 17, was last seen on May 11, 1981; he was found on May 12, 1981; the cause of death was ligature strangulation.</p>

            <h2>2. COLIN PITCHFORK MURDERS — THE BIRTH OF DNA FORENSIC EVIDENCE (1983)</h2>
            
            <p>Colin Pitchfork. Just the name conjures up a devilish image—an evil monster—a story-villain of homicidal psychopathy. But Colin Pitchfork wasn’t a fictional work, though, like Hannibal Lecter. Pitchfork was a real serial murderer and sexual deviant who raped and strangled at least two teen girls in England in the mid-1980s as well as committing countless sexual offenses. And he was the first killer in the world to be convicted through DNA forensic evidence.
                Four decades later, DNA forensic evidence is commonplace. So commonplace, in fact, that juries expect it. Through a phenomenon called the CSI Effect, clever defense counsels can plant doubtful seeds in jurors’ minds where they’ll wrongfully acquit a perfectly guilty person if there’s no DNA evidence linking the accused to the crime.
                That wasn’t the case with Colin Pitchfork. He was perfectly guilty of murder, and DNA evidence proved it. We’ll look at the Pitchfork case facts in a moment and then do a DNA Forensic Evidence 101 crash course, but first let me tell you a bit of my police investigation background and why I have the authority to write this piece on the birth of DNA forensic evidence.</p>
            <p>In the 1990s, when DNA evidence was under development, I was an active homicide detective with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Serious Crimes Section. I was peripherally involved in surreptitiously collecting a biological sample from a suspect (later convicted) in the first DNA evidence trial in Canadian courts. Ryan Jason Love was taken down solely through DNA evidence for the 1990 murder of Lucie Turmel, a female cab driver who Love stabbed to death in the resort town of Banff, Alberta.
                I was in the right place at the right time (DNA career-wise) in 1995 when Canada passed Bill C-104 Forensic DNA Analysis, a federal law. This legislation authorized search warrants for DNA sample collection on uncooperative suspects. The day the bill passed senate assent, I investigated a violent sexual assault where a police dog tracked and not-so-gently tackled a fleeing suspect. I executed the first DNA search warrant in Canada that resulted in convicting serial rapist Rodney John Camp.
                Enough about me and my DNA exploits. Let’s take a quick look at the Colin Pitchfork murders and then try to make simple sense of this complicated business called DNA forensic evidence.</p>
        
            <h3>The Colin Pitchfork Murders</h3>
            
            <p>In November 1983, 15-year-old Lynda Mann’s body was found in the Narborough area of England, approximately one hundred miles northwest of London. She’d been beaten, raped, and murdered along a deserted pathway known as the Black Pad. Forensic evidence, at that time, determined semen on her was from a relatively common blood type that matched ten percent of males. The case fell cold after months of extensive investigation.
                A second girl, 15-year-old Dawn Ashworth was found dead in July 1986. She’d also been beaten, raped, and strangled in a secluded Narborough footpath called Ten Pound Lane. As with Lynda Mann, the same semen type was on and in her body.
                The Ashworth investigation revitalized the Mann file and the two cases became the Narborough Enquiry. Famed American crime writer Joseph Wambaugh would later write his book The Blooding about the phenomenal effort British authorities put into the investigations. Homicide detectives knew they had a serial killer—the similar blood types, the locations, and the modus operandis (MOs) were too strikingly similar to suggest otherwise.</p>
            <p>The question was who donated the semen and how police could conclusively prove it.
                Enter Alec Jefferys and his scientific team at the British Forensic Science Service. They’d been hard at work identifying Deoxyribonucleic Acid—the DNA double-helix molecule that provides a genetic fingerprint that’s unique to an individual except for identical twins. Jefferys & Company knew they were onto a world-changing forensic evidence breakthrough, and they used the Narborough Enquiry as a test case.                
                Initially in the Ashworth file, a strong suspect developed. He was a developmentally challenged youth named Richard Buckland who confessed under duress to the Dawn Ashworth murder. However, Buckland strongly denied the Lynda Mann slaying.                
                By late 1986, Alec Jefferys’ team had their DNA identification process to the point where they were confident it could withstand courtroom scrutiny. The police took a blood sample from Richard Buckland and delivered it to the Jefferys lab. Conclusively, the lab results said, Buckland was not the semen donor in either the Mann or Ashworth killings. However, the DNA profile conclusively proved the Narborough killer was the same man.                
                Richard Buckland was a first—the first wrongfully accused person to be exonerated by DNA forensic evidence. Relying on a false confession is a law enforcement lesson harshly learned by detectives, but the British investigators moved on to find the real killer. The question was how?</p>        
            <p>The answer was a process of elimination.
                The Narborough Enquirers took on the monumental task of getting blood samples for DNA analysis from as many late teen and adult males in the Narborough region as possible. This became known as “blooding” suspects and, after over 4,500 bloodings, it paid off.                
                In August 1987, police got a tip that one Ian Kelly had fraudulently submitted his blood sample to cover up for a friend, Colin Pitchfork. Both men worked as bakers in Narborough, and the plan backfired. Police took blood from Pitchfork under a court order. It matched the semen DNA profile in the Mann and Ashworth murders.                
                Colin Pitchfork confessed and got a life sentence. He also admitted to performing around 1,000 indecent exposure acts as well as other violent sexual assaults. Pitchfork’s motive for killing Lynda and Dawn, he said, was not for sexual gratification. He did it because the girls could identify him.                
                Since the first blooding that led to DNA forensic being soundly based in worldwide courtrooms, and even compounding the frustrating CSI Effect problem, DNA extraction and processing science has advanced leaps and bounds. Today, processing DNA for forensic evidence is mostly routine. Here’s a brief look—call it a crash course—in DNA Forensic Evidence 101.</p>
            </div>
        
            <h3>DNA Forensic Evidence 101</h3>
            <p>Scientists have studied genetics since the early 1800s when Gregor Mendel suggested his theory that all living organisms had genetic blueprints that described and allowed their physical structure. Mendel also theorized all living organisms shared basic hereditary traits. Mr. Mendel did an interesting experiment with peas and proved that dominant and recessive genes got passed from parent to offspring. It’s a principle applying to peas and humans alike.
                In the 1860s, Friedrich Meischer was the first to identify DNA in human blood white cells. (Note: DNA molecules do not appear in red blood cells because red cells are not really cells—they don’t have a nucleus which DNA needs to build a cell—DNA being the building blocks of cells.) By the 1920s, mainstream science widely accepted the DNA theory of genetics and inherited traits. And in the 1950s, famed genetic scientists James Watson and Francis Crick accurately described and isolated chemical structure in the double helix molecule.                
                Knowledge of this structure, the double helix, allowed Alec Jeffreys and his team to develop extraction, multiplication, and comparison techniques of DNA signatures within all species. DNA blueprints are present in the smallest of life’s creatures like gastropod mollusks to the largest like blue whales and are around 99.9% similar in every living species known to science. It’s that small 0.1% difference that makes species, and specimens within each species, entirely unique.                
                Your human body produces around 230 billion new cells each day. Nature programmed you for cell division where, uncontrolled by your conscious actions, your cells will divide into two with the new half receiving behavioral instructions from the old half. People being people and nature being nature, there are always small errors or slight changes to the genetic blueprint. Over time and through trillions of cell splits, we all become slightly different. Except, of course, for monozygotic or identical twins. (Science now finds tiny differences in monozygotic DNA structures at the mitochondrial level, but that’s for DNA 301.)</p>
            <p>Collection — where a biological sample is found at a crime scene.
                <br>Extraction — where DNA is released from the cell at the lab.<br>Quantification — where the lab determines how much DNA they have to work with. <br>Amplification — where the lab copies the DNA to characterize it.
                <br>Separation — where the lab separates amplified DNA for identification. <br>Analysis and Interpretation — where the lab compares DNA to other known profiles.
                <br>Statistical Computation — where the lab calculates a match’s probability. <br>Quality Assurance — where the lab triple checks process accuracy. <br>Evidence Delivery — where the lab testifies about their conclusion(s).</p>
            <p>In 1987, the birth of Colin Pitchfork’s DNA evidence process was slow, labor extensive, and extremely expensive. It might have even been painful. That’s no longer the case, as four decades has taken this science—originally deemed pseudoscience—and molded it into fast, economical, and highly reliable forensic evidence used around the world. Now, if science could find a permanent remedy for the CSI Effect, that’d be a real breakthrough.
                So, you’ve graduated from the DyingWords crash course in DNA Forensic Evidence 101 and your certificate is in the mail. If there’s enough interest, I may run crash courses 201 and 301 where I’ll invite some expert DNA guest lecturers to explain the differences between loci and markers and why the Southern Blot is so slow compared to Rapid and maybe talk fun stuff like Touch DNA, Mixtures, CODIS, and Dirty.</p>

        <h2>3. How the Tylenol murders of 1982 changed the way we consume medication (1982)</h2>
        <img src="/case3(3.1).jpg" alt="">
        <p>Early on the morning of Sept. 29, 1982, a tragic, medical mystery began with a sore throat and a runny nose. It was then that Mary Kellerman, a 12-year-old girl from Elk Grove Village, a suburb of Chicago, told her mother and father about her symptoms. They gave her one extra-strength Tylenol capsule that, unbeknownst to them, was laced with the highly poisonous potassium cyanide. Mary was dead by 7 a.m. Within a week, her death would panic the entire nation. And only months later, it changed the way we purchase and consume over-the-counter medications.</p>
        <p>That same day, a 27-year-old postal worker named Adam Janus of Arlington Heights, Illinois, died of what was initially thought to be a massive heart attack but turned out to be cyanide poisoning as well. His brother and sister-in-law, Stanley, 25, and Theresa, 19, of Lisle, Illinois, rushed to his home to console their loved ones. Both experienced throbbing headaches, a not uncommon response to a death in the family and each took a Tylenol extra-strength capsule or two from the same bottle Adam had used earlier in the day. Stanley died that very day and Theresa died two days later.</p>
        <img src="/case3(3.2).png" alt="">
        <p>Over the next few days, three more strange deaths occurred: 35-year-old Mary McFarland of Elmhurst, Illinois, 35-year-old Paula Prince of Chicago, and 27-year-old Mary Weiner of Winfield, Illinois. All of them, it turned out, took Tylenol shortly before they died.
            <br>It was at this point, early October of 1982, that investigators made the connection between the poisoning deaths and Tylenol, the best-selling, non-prescription pain reliever sold in the United States at that time. The gelatin-based capsules were especially popular because they were slick and easy to swallow. Unfortunately, each victim swallowed a Tylenol capsule laced with A lethal dose of cyanide.</p>
        <p>McNeil Consumer Products, a subsidiary of the health care giant, Johnson & Johnson, manufactured Tylenol. To its credit, the company took an active role with the media in issuing mass warning communications and immediately called for a massive recall of the more than 31 million bottles of Tylenol in circulation. Tainted capsules were discovered in early October in a few other grocery stores and drug stores in the Chicago area, but, fortunately, they had not yet been sold or consumed. McNeill and Johnson & Johnson offered replacement capsules to those who turned in pills already purchased and a reward for anyone with information leading to the apprehension of the individual or people involved in these random murders.</p>
        <h3>The ‘awful’ work of the real doctors who inspired M*A*S*H.</h3>
        <p>The case continued to be confusing to the police, the drug maker and the public at large. For example, Johnson & Johnson quickly established that the cyanide lacing occurred after cases of Tylenol left the factory. Someone, police hypothesized, must have taken bottles off the shelves of local grocers and drug stores in the Chicago area, laced the capsules with poison, and then returned the restored packages to the shelves to be purchased by the unknowing victims.</p>
        <p>To this day, however, the perpetrators of these murders have never been found.
            One man, James Lewis, claiming to be the Tylenol killer wrote a “ransom” letter to Johnson & Johnson demanding $1 million in exchange for stopping the poisonings. After a lengthy cat and mouse game, police and federal investigators determined that Lewis lived in New York and had no demonstrable links to the Chicago events. That said, he was charged with extortion and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released in 1995 after serving only 13 years.</p>
        <h3>James Lewis, suspect in the 1982 Tylenol murders, dies at 76.</h3>
        <p>Other “copy-cat” poisonings, involving Tylenol and other over-the-counter medications, cropped up again in the 1980s and early 1990s but these events were never as dramatic or as deadly as the 1982 Chicago-area deaths. Conspiracy theories about motives and suspects for all these heinous acts continue to be bandied about on the Internet to this day.
            <br>Before the 1982 crisis, Tylenol controlled more than 35 percent of the over-the-counter pain reliever market; only a few weeks after the murders, that number plummeted to less than 8 percent. The dire situation, both in terms of human life and business, made it imperative that the Johnson & Johnson executives respond swiftly and authoritatively.</p>
        <p>For example, Johnson & Johnson developed new product protection methods and ironclad pledges to do better in protecting their consumers in the future. Working with FDA officials, they introduced a new tamper-proof packaging, which included foil seals and other features that made it obvious to a consumer if foul play had transpired. These packaging protections soon became the industry standard for all over-the-counter medications. The company also introduced price reductions and a new version of their pills — called the “caplet” — a tablet coated with slick, easy-to-swallow gelatin but far harder to tamper with than the older capsules which could be easily opened, laced with a contaminant, and then placed back in the older non-tamper-proof bottle.</p>
        <p>Within a year, and after an investment of more than $100 million, Tylenol’s sales rebounded to its healthy past and it became, once again, the nation’s favorite over-the-counter pain reliever. Critics who had prematurely announced the death of the brand Tylenol were now praising the company’s handling of the matter. Indeed, the Johnson & Johnson recall became a classic case study in business schools across the nation.
            <br>In 1983, the U.S. Congress passed what was called “the Tylenol bill,” making it a federal offense to tamper with consumer products. In 1989, the FDA established federal guidelines for manufacturers to make all such products tamper-proof.</p>
        <p>Sadly, the tragedies that resulted from the Tylenol poisonings can never be undone. But their deaths did inspire a series of important moves to make over-the-counter medications safer (albeit never 100 percent safe) for the hundreds of millions of people who buy them every year.</p>
