                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>Forensic anthropology is a specialized field that applies the principles and techniques of physical anthropology to legal investigations, primarily involving human remains. The discipline focuses on identifying individuals from their skeletal remains and determining factors such as age, sex, ancestry, stature, and any trauma or pathological conditions that might shed light on their identity or cause of death. This information is crucial in criminal investigations, disaster victim identification, and historical research.</p>

        <h1>Case Studies in Forensic Anthropology:  
            Bonified Skeletons</h1>
        <h2> By Heather M. Garvin and Natalie R. Langley, CRC Press  
            Reviewed by Samantha Coberly, University of Florida  </h2>
        <img src="/anthrostory.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p> <b>Introduction:</b>
            The book includes chapters from 
            established scholars in the field as well 
            as up and coming practitioners. The 
            book is split into five sections: Estimation 
            of Biological Profile and Positive Identifi
            cation; Forensic Taphonomy; Trauma; 
            Human Rights and Mass Disasters; and 
            Other Considerations. Some of the sec
            tions are more diverse in their topics than 
            others. The taphonomy section in partic
            ular has an assorted array of topics, with 
            chapters on thermal damage, chemical 
            damage, dismemberments, water depo
            sitions and mites. Estimation of the bio
            logical profile on the other hand is nar
            rower in scope as it mainly focuses on 
            ancestry, although the identification por
            tion of that section has several different 
            types of identification presented. There 
            are 4-6 chapters in each section for a to
            tal of 27 chapters. The chapters are not 
            long, ranging from 7-16 pages for a total 
            of roughly 300 pages. Each chapter pre
            sents one or more case studies that illus
            trate a specific topic. All the chapters met 
            the goal of presenting a clear concise 
            case study that dealt with the history of 
            the case, the analyses of interest and the 
            outcome if known.  <br> 
            The book is well organized and with some standardization. Each chapter has a lesson learned 
            section and a set of discussion questions. It is interesting to see how each author interpreted these 
            parts of the chapter. Some authors choose discussion questions that were more specific to the case 
            presented in the chapter while others proposed more overarching questions about the topic and the field. There were some differences in how each author approached their chapter. A few authors gave 
            a more bare-bones description of the case with little background on the topic the case is showcasing. 
            Others gave a more detailed background on the topic citing multiple studies. There were a few chap
            ters that left me wishing the authors had gone into the background more extensively. Several of the 
            cases presented were unresolved according to the chapter(s): the perpetrator may not have been 
            caught; there was no next of kin for DNA; the forensic anthropologist was not told the outcome of 
            the trial. All of these endings, while not satisfactory to the reader, do well to show the reality of 
            investigations.  
            According to the editors, the book is intended for both upper level students of anthropology 
            as well as those already practicing within the field. I would say the lessons learned and discussion 
            questions are more geared to the student audience rather than the professional one. The student 
            should already have an understanding of the basics of forensic anthropology and osteology. Many 
            of the questions were ones that would be asked in a classroom setting for students still learning 
            about forensic methodology. Students would also benefit from seeing the methods they are learning 
            about implemented in a real-life scenario. Perhaps a further study section would have been benefi
            cial to students as well, for when they want to explore a topic further. There were a few chapters that 
            proposed questions which professionals should also be considering in terms of how the field ap
            proaches certain topics such as how anthropologists determine ancestry and how ancestry is re
            ported to medical examiners and law enforcement. The book does have up to date methodologies 
            and techniques that professionals should be aware of. An example of this is chapter one which 
            discusses the use of social media in homicide investigations. For both the student and the profes
            sional the book does have some very interesting case studies that do a satisfactory job of highlighting 
            the methods and techniques the authors wished to discuss.  
            The editors also note that one of the book’s key features are the color photos; they really are 
            stunning. All photos included add value to the topic and clearly illustrate the important points or 
            concepts the authors are making in the chapter. Even chapters without color photos have well de
            fined figures that do well to showcase the author’s points. Another key feature is the thought process 
            of each individual examining the cases. Each author discusses the analyses that led them to their 
            conclusions such as what methods they used to generate a biological profile or their trauma assess
            ment. One of the strengths of the book was the detailing of the thought process and rationale behind 
            each of the decisions the forensic anthropologists made which would be helpful for both students 
            and professionals.  
            Overall, the book would be a good one to have in any forensic anthropologist’s collection 
            whether they are students or professionals. The photos are great and the cases interesting. The 
            book has thorough information about up to date methods and techniques and their application in the 
            field of forensic anthropology today.

        <!-- <p> <b>Case 1: Corpse Found from Residential Area:</b>
            On March 30th, 2015, the body of 40 years old male, in the 
           bloated stage of decomposition was recovered from a residential 
           area of distt. Ludhiana, Punjab (India). The body of the deceased 
           was discolored, facial features were hardly recognizable and 
           genitals were fully decomposed as the genitals were chopped 
           off. Forensic examination found incised wounds 8×1cm deep on 
           the left side of the neck and another wound 15×12cm present 
           between the legs. The death was attributed to murder by multiple 
           stabbing. Entomofauna found on the body were maggots and 
           pupae of Chrysomya megacephala  </p>

           <br>
        <p><b> Case 2: Diptera and Coleoptera on Skeletonized Body:</b> 
            A partially mummified body of a 26 years old male was found 
            from his residence at Patiala, Punjab (India) on 22nd April, 2015. 
            Body was in livor mortis stage. In this stage blood appears on the 
            skin as purplish-red discoloration (like a bruise) and can give 
            indication of position of the body at the time of death. The body 
            was partially skeletonized in the neck region and upper chest 
            002
             where underlying bones were fully exposed. Facial features were 
            unidentifiable, soft tissue including the skin is missing from the 
            right side of face, head, neck and upper part of chest.  Cause of 
            death was unknown. Entomofauna found on the corpse consists 
            of different instars of larvae of Chrysomya rufifacies and beetles 
            belonging to family Dermestidae and Cleridae i.e Dermestes 
            maculatus and Necrobia rufipes <br>
            <img src="/entocase2.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <p><b> Case 3: Drowning Case:</b>
                A dead body of about 52 years old female was recovered 
               from Bhakra canal, Patiala, Punjab (India) on 22nd April, 2015. 
               The body was in bloating stage of decomposition with partially 
               identifiable facial features. Body was emitting foul smell. Whole 
               body was inflated with water, as muddy water was present in 
               larynx, trachea and stomach which was reported during post
               mortem examination. Peeling of skin was reported on abdomen 
               and limbs. Egg batches and adults of Chrysomya megacephala 
               were present all over the body. Beetles belonging to family 
               Histeridae were reported on corpse. Later egg batches were 
               transferred to rearing jar provided with a piece of goat meat as 
               rearing medium. Rearing helps in identification of fly as well as 
               calculation of PMI  <br>
