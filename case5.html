        <h2>1. Delhi Nirbhaya Case (2012)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The Delhi Nirbhaya case refers to the brutal gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, Jyoti Singh Pandey, later known as Nirbhaya by the media for anonymity, in *Delhi, India, on December 16, 2012. The case attracted nationwide and global attention due to the shocking nature of the crime and the subsequent outcry for justice and changes in laws concerning sexual violence in India.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="/case5(1.1).png" alt="">
        <p><ul>
            <li><h4>The Crime:</h4></li>
            <li> Nirbhaya, along with a male friend, was traveling home from a movie on a bus. Six men, including the bus driver, lured them into an empty bus and then attacked them. Nirbhaya was raped repeatedly and tortured with an iron rod. After the assault, the perpetrators left her and her friend injured on the roadside. Nirbhaya sustained severe injuries, including damage to her internal organs, and was later flown to Singapore for treatment, where she died from her injuries on December 29, 2012.</li>
            <li><h4>The Arrest:</h4></li>
            <li>The police quickly began their investigation. Six suspects were identified and arrested: Ram Singh (the bus driver), Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta, and a juvenile (later identified as a minor).</li>
        <img src="/case5(1.2).jpg" alt="">
            <li><h4>The Trail:</h4></li>
            <li>The trial process was long, with public and media pressure mounting for swift justice. Four of the adult suspects were sentenced to death, while the juvenile was given a sentence of three years in a juvenile facility, leading to widespread public criticism of India's juvenile justice laws.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>How Forensic Science Helped Solve the Case:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li><h4>DNA Analysis:</h4></li>
            <li>DNA evidence played a pivotal role in identifying the perpetrators and linking them to the crime. *Nirbhaya's clothes* and *biological samples* were collected during her medical examination. The forensic examination found semen and other bodily fluids, which were crucial in identifying the attackers.</li>
            <li>DNA profiles from the crime scene were matched with those of the suspects, leading to their identification and confirming their involvement in the crime. The investigation was one of the early high-profile cases in India to use *advanced DNA profiling* techniques, which were critical for the conviction.</li>
            <li><h4>Fingerprint Evidence:</h4></li>
            <li>Fingerprints found inside the bus and on the victim's clothing were matched with those of the suspects. This was another key piece of evidence linking the men to the crime scene.</li>
            <li>Analysis of the bus and the victim’s belongings helped confirm that the crime took place aboard the bus, which had been cleaned by the suspects after the incident.            </li>
            <li><h4>Victim's Testimony:</h4></li>
            <li>Although seriously injured, Nirbhaya was able to provide a detailed *testimony* about her attackers before being flown to Singapore. She identified the bus and the men who assaulted her, which was crucial in helping police arrest the suspects. Her ability to describe the incident in detail assisted the investigation.            </li>
            <li><h4>Medical Evidence:</h4></li>
            <li> The medical examination of Nirbhaya’s body showed signs of severe physical trauma, confirming that she had been raped, tortured, and assaulted with a blunt object (the iron rod).</li>
            <li>The forensic team documented the injuries, which were later used in court to establish the brutality of the attack. Nirbhaya’s body was found to have *severe internal injuries*, including damage to her reproductive organs, which contributed to her death.</li>
            <li><h4>Digital Evidence:</h4></li>
            <li>Mobile phone records and CCTV footage were also used to trace the movements of the suspects. The police managed to track the route the bus took and identify the location where the attack occurred. Digital evidence also helped in confirming the presence of the suspects at the crime scene.</li>
            <li><h4>Forensic Pathology:</h4></li>
            <li>The forensic pathologists conducted an autopsy on Nirbhaya’s body, which provided essential evidence of the cause of death and the extent of the injuries she sustained. The pathologists documented the nature of the assaults, which were crucial in the court proceedings.</li>
            <li><h4>Psychological Profiles:</h4></li>
            <li>*Psychological profiling* and statements from the suspects were used during the investigation. The accused provided varying and inconsistent confessions, and these were analyzed to understand the motivations behind the crime. Psychological experts assisted in understanding the mindset of the perpetrators.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>Legal Outcome:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Ram Singh, the driver of the bus, committed suicide in prison in March 2013.</li>
            <li>The four adult suspects (Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, and Pawan Gupta) were convicted and sentenced to death. They appealed their sentences, but the Supreme Court of India upheld their convictions in 2017, and they were executed by hanging on March 20, 2020.</li>
            <li>The juvenile offender, who was 17 at the time of the crime, was tried in a juvenile court and sentenced to three years in a correctional facility. This led to widespread anger and demands for changes to India’s juvenile justice laws.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h3>Impact of the Case:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>The Nirbhaya case became a *turning point* in India’s struggle against sexual violence. It brought widespread attention to the inadequacies in the legal system, the importance of *forensic science* in investigations, and the *need for harsher laws* for crimes against women.</li>
            <li>The case prompted *mass protests* and calls for reforms in police handling of sexual assault cases. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 was passed, increasing penalties for sexual violence and introducing new laws to protect women.</li>
            <li>Public outcry over the juvenile justice system led to the *juvenile law being amended*, raising the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18 in cases of heinous crimes like rape and murder.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <img src="/case5(1.3).jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>The Nirbhaya case highlighted the importance of forensic science, especially DNA analysis, fingerprint identification, and medical evidence, in solving complex criminal cases. It also underscored the role of technology, such as CCTV and mobile records, in modern criminal investigations. While the case brought much-needed reforms to India’s criminal justice system, it also reminded the world of the continuing challenges in addressing crimes of sexual violence.</li>

        <img src="/case5(2.7).png" alt="">
        <h3>Jan. 4, 2023: Suspect arrives in Idaho</h3>
        <img src="/case5(2.8).png" alt="">
        <p>Bryan Kohberger is brought to Idaho. The judge issues a gag order, which prohibits officials and others involved in the case from speaking about it. </p>
        <h3>Jan. 5, 2023: Court documents released</h3>
        <p>Public officials release an affidavit in the case against Bryan Kohberger. Among the findings:

            <br>A witness claims she saw a figure of "5'10 or taller, male, not very muscular" dressed in black clothing and a mask on the night of the murders. She said the masked figure walked toward the black sliding glass door and she locked herself in her room.
            <br>The DNA found on the button snap of a leather knife sheath at the crime scene appears to be a strong match with the DNA found in the trash at the Kohberger family residence in Albrightsville, Pa.
            <br>Investigators believe the homicides occurred between 4 a.m. and 4:25 a.m.
            <br>Kohberger applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department and in his application essay he said he had an interest in assisting in rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technological data.
            <br>Investigators checked the movements of Kohberger's phone and it stops reporting a signal at 2:47 a.m. and appears to turn back on at 4:48 a.m. This means the phone may have been in area without cell coverage or the phone was turned off.</p>
        <h3>May 5, 2023: Kohberger stopped by police a month before killings</h3>
        <p>Newly-released body camera video shows Bryan Kohberger being pulled over for allegedly running a red light about a month before the killings. The video shows campus police at Washington State University stopping Kohberger on Oct. 14, 2022, in Pullman, the Idaho Statesman reported. The officer eventually lets him go with a warning.</p>
        <h3>June 21, 2023: A DNA match</h3>
        <p>A DNA sample taken from Bryan Kohberger revealed a near-exact match to the DNA found on a knife sheath at the scene of the quadruple murder in Idaho last November, according to new court documents. DNA found on the sheath was initially compared to DNA from trash recovered outside the Kohberger family home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, last year.  A cheek swab taken from Kohberger allowed for another, more direct DNA comparison.</p>
        <h3>June 27, 2024: Trial date set for Kohberger</h3>
        <p>A district court judge has set a June 2025 start date for the Bryan Kohberger's criminal trial.. Both the defense and prosecuting attorneys agreed to the court's proposed trial schedule during a hearing in Latah County, where the killings happened. Kohberger appeared at the hearing.

            <br>Latah County District Judge John Judge said he anticipates the trial will last three months. That would account for two weeks of jury selection, eight weeks of the trial itself, and another two weeks for the verdict, sentencing and anything else remaining, he said.</p>
        <h3>Nov. 19, 2024: Kohberger can face the death penalty if convicted</h3>  
        <p>Kohberger's defense team had sought to remove the death penalty as a possible punishment should he be convicted, but Ada County Judge Steven Hippler denied their motions in his ruling dated Tuesday. The prosecution has said it intends to seek the death penalty if Kohberger is convicted.</p>
        <p>Kohberger's attorneys' arguments included claims that forcing inmates to wait for years on death row and the methods available for prisoners to be executed in Idaho both constitute cruel and unusual punishment. They also argued Idaho's death penalty laws violate an international treaty banning the torture of prisoners.</p>
