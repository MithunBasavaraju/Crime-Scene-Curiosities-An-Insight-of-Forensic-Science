                <h2>Overview:</h2>
                <p>Forensic ballistics is the science of analyzing firearms, ammunition, and the effects of their use in criminal investigations. It focuses on understanding the mechanics of firearms, the trajectory of projectiles, and the characteristics of gunshot wounds or impacts. The field aids in identifying the type of weapon used, matching bullets or shell casings to specific firearms, and reconstructing shooting incidents to determine how events unfolded.

        <h1>Murder Mystery Solved with the Help of Forensic Investigation </h1>
        <h2>Mukesh Sharma1, Deepak Sharma
            1 Assistant Director (Physics Div.) State FSL, Jaipur (Raj.) 
            2 SSA (Physics Division), Regional FSL, Bharatpur (Raj.) 
            Received 5 April 2020</h2>
        <!-- <img src="/storypers.jpg" alt="" srcset=""> -->
        <p> <b>Introduction:</b>
            The Crime scene was reconstructed on the bases of scientific experimentation and 
experience of the forensic scientists. Its steps and stages followed basic scientific 
principles, theory formulation and logical methodology1,2. During the reconstruction all 
investigative information with physical evidence analysis and interpretation 
incorporated which was molded into a reasonable explanation of the activity and related events. During this logic, careful observation, and considerable experience, 
both in crime scene investigation and forensic testing played a critical role. All data 
concerning the condition of physical evidence, patterns and impressions, condition of 
the victim, etc., was reviewed, organized, and studied3-7. 
Crime Scene visiting is so necessary for coming to a conclusion in some of the 
mysterious cases is a must, in Identifying a dead person, time since death & cause of 
Death. Suicide and murder cases, are committed, where firearm are used due to easy 
availability of firearm with them. In order to reconstruct the crime, physical evidence of 
shooting cases are referred for forensic examination along with scene of crime study, 
body of the victim to establish the crime. The determination of suicide is supported not 
only by the presence of close range wound but also by crime scene study, case history 
of the victim along with autopsy report.
        </p><br>
        <img src="/ballis story.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p> <b>Case History:</b><br>
            In the present case study report is unique and rare case of suspicious death, wherein 
the manner of death (suicide or homicide) was identified in the death scene of crime 
itself through available physical evidences. As per IO a lady left the house receiving a 
call on her cell phone. Since she did not return home till late evening, the husband and 
her children made search but could not trace out. Subsequently, a missing report was 
lodged in the local police station. At night, on the same day, the dead body of the 
missing lady was found lying in a bathroom of a Hotel along with a male dead body. 
We have been called by the IO for the scientific add. We have visited and gave the 
direction to the IO on the basis of our observations, case was solved at spot of 
occurrence (SO). </p>
           <br>
           <img src="/ballis story1.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
        <p><b>Observations:</b> <br>
            Crime scene is a treasure of information. Forensic expert should apply their knowledge 
and skill to identify the fact in the crime scene, so that the fact may be accepted by the 
sentencing authorities in the court. The present case report provided valuable 
information in a suspicious death. The observations of our team at the spot are as 
under: <br>
1.The room of the hotel was locked from the inside and there was no other 
key or gate or window to enter or exit from the room. As per the Hotel reception the room was booked in the afternoon, not a single order for food/tea was received from 
this room. <br>
2.The room was opened forcefully, and at the time of entry the floor of the 
room was smeared with blood drops and some partial barefoot impressions. One tool 
box and leather bag with tool was found near the double bed, on the tea table. Some 
blood drop were also present on the bag had been detected. All the blood spot were 
tested using prelim test. <br>
3.After entering into the bathroom of the hotel room, where both the bodies 
were lying. One fired cartridge was found in the washbasin of the bathroom. <br>
4.The lady had an injury near the ear and the male person had on the 
forehead injury. The country made firearm (Country made pistol CMP) found in 
between the fingure of the male hand. Some tattooing and GSR might have possible 
on the hands of the male body, after applying the prelim test, GSR observed on the 
hand of the male dead body.  <br>
<img src="/ballis story2.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
            <p><b>Discussion:</b><br>
                On the IO was in doubt what might happen, who killed whom or it was a murder 
mystery. On the bases of our fourfold observations, 1. the entry of the hotel room was 
closed from the inside; 2. blood droplet on the tool bag of the person having blood 
drop; 3. one cartridge case was found in the firearm and one in the washbasin; 4. bare foot marks of the male on the floor. 
On these observations, the dilemma was cleared 
and the report was explained point by point. The male first made sexual relation with 
lady, then in fired her with the CMP in the bathroom, came out in the room search for 
second bullet in his bag, using which he was planned to commit suicide for himself. 
Change the bullet at washbasin and fired own his own. The cases was resolved at the 
spot, the all the evidence collected have been send to the laboratory for further and 
necessary examinations, which are not included in the article. <br>
<img src="/ballis story3.jpg" alt="" srcset=""><br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
It is established that evidence tells a story and helps an investigator re-create the crime 
scene and establishing the sequence of events at spot10, those related to firearms, 
GSR is the key evidence for it. If physical evidences (like blood stains, GSR and 
struggling marks) analyzed and interpreted properly, those will help to take the right 
path for investigation agency. These physical evidences are more reliable than 
testimonial evidences11. On the basis of our spot observations, blood prelim test, GSR 
pretest and sequence of happening (reconstruction), we have given as proper direction 
of investigation to the IO and cases was resolved on the basis of Physical evidences.
