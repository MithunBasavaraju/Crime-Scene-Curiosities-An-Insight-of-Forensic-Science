        <h2>1. Belgium child murders (1996)</h2>
        <img src="/case4(1.1).png" alt="">
        <h3>Exactly 25 years ago today, on 15 August 1996, TV audiences in Belgium witnessed the release from captivity of two young girls from a grisly cellar in Marcinelle by Charleroi.</h3>
        <p>The case that was about to follow would see three convictions, the solution to four other missing person cases, and would eventually lead to the reform of the justice system and the total overhaul of the policing system in Belgium.</p>
        <p>9/8/1996: Laetitia Delhez, then aged 14, vanished after leaving the public swimming pool in Bertrix in Luxembourg province on 9 August. A witness remembered a scruffy white van making a terrible engine noise, and took down a partial registration number. The van belonged to Dutroux, who police quickly found had previous convictions for rape.
        <p>13/8/1996: Police raid the various houses owned by Dutroux and make three arrests: Dutroux himself, his then-wife Michelle Martin, and Michel Lelièvre - a petty crook and drug addict who depended on Dutroux for whatever he had.</p>            
        <p>15/8/1996: "I’m going to give you two girls." With those words to a police investigator, Marc Dutroux, a scrap dealer and convicted rapist, was about to seal his own fate for life, as well as save the lives of two teenage girls and solve the mystery of the disappearance of four others.
            The job of interrogating Dutroux fell to gendarme Michel Demoulin, who recently told the VRT: "It made no sense to immediately confront him with the question of whether he had kidnapped Laetitia Delhez. I had to start the conversation first and build a relationship of trust with him."  
            Surprisingly, the house searches turned up nothing, despite the presence of sniffer dogs. Police thought they were looking for one girl. In the end, Dutroux gave up two.</p>
        <p>28/5/96: Sabine Dardenne, aged 12, goes missing on her way to school in Tournai. By August, the trail had gone cold, like so many other cases of missing children. But when Dutroux offered to hand over two girls instead of just one, the second turned out to be Sabine, who was being kept prisoner in the same miserable dungeon as Laetitia. The two girls were liberated together. Laetitia had been captive for six days, Sabine for 80.
            The liberation of the two girls, and further confessions by Dutroux and confederates, soon made it clear that not only two girls had been victims of his crimes, but six.</p>
        <p>24/6/1995: Two eight-year-old friends, Julie Lejeune and Mélissa Russo from Grace-Hollogne near Liège are out walking together when they disappear apparently without trace. The case is picked up by the gendarmerie, but little progress is made. The two sets of parents, who are to become household names and faces across the country, will not accept the lack of progress and move heaven and earth to get results, at some personal cost.</p>
        <img src="/case4(1.2).png" alt="">
        <p>17/8/96: The bodies of Julie and Mélissa are recovered buried at one of the houses owned by Dutroux-Martin in Sars-la Buissière. The two children had been locked up in an underground cell built specially and had starved to death while Dutroux was in prison on other charges. His wife, Martin, had been charged by him to feed the girls, he argued, but she had been afraid to visit the house. Later, their bodies had been frozen in bin-bags for a time before being buried.</p>
        <img src="/case4(1.3).png" alt="">
        <p>22-23/8/1995: Shortly after the abduction of Julie and Mélissa, Dutroux broke with his habit and committed his next crime in Flanders, abducting Eefje Lambrecks (19) and An Marchal (17) in Ostend after they had attended a hypnosis show while on holiday at the coast with their parents.</p>
        <p>3/9/1996: The remains of An and Eefje are recovered in the grounds of a Dutroux property in Jumet near Charleroi. Also in the same burial place, the body of Bernard Weinstein - a former accomplice who Dutroux murdered over some dispute - was found. </p>
        <img src="/case4(1.4).png" alt="">
        <p>1/3/2004: The trial of Dutroux, Michelle Martin, and Michel Lelièvre begins in Arlon, as well as Michel Nihoul, a Brussels-based businessman accused of being an accomplice in the press, but charged only with conspiracy to provide drugs.</p>
        <p>17/6/2004: The jury returns its verdict. Dutroux: guilty of six charges of kidnapping and four of murder, as well as three counts of the rape of girls in Slovakia. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, considered to equate to 30 years, but can be detained for a further ten years at the discretion of the government. The sentence dates back to his first arrest in 1996, meaning he could still be in prison until 2036.</p>            
        <p>It remains legally possible but unlikely that he would ever be released into society. In all likelihood, he would be committed to a psychiatric forensic unit for the rest of his days.
            Martin was sentenced to 30 years and is already at liberty under conditions. Michel Lelièvre received 25 years. He, too, is now free. Nihoul was given five years for drugs charges and died in 2019.</p>

            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Evidence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dog collar: class, had many similar ones bought. </li>
            <li>Twine: individual, produces only one batch.</li>
            <li>Hairs: individual, used mitochondrial DNA.</li>
            <li>Carpet: individual, had specific dye patterns.</li>
            <li>Bloodstains: individual, belonged to Leanne Tiernan.</li>
            <li>Cable Ties: class, specific to company</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Crime Scene Description</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Body found wrapped in a floral duvet cover and buried in a shallow grave.</li>
            <li>Black plastic bag over her head, held in place with a dog collar.</li>
            <li>Scarf and cable tied around her neck.</li>
            <li>Cable ties holding her wrists together</li>
            <li>Body wrapped with green plastic bin liners, tied with twine.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Crime Scene Evaluation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When Leanne had disappeared, more than 1,000 properties were searched, a 3-mile canal was drained and garbage was not collected.</li>
            <li>The parents provided emotional appeals and there were several sightings of Tiernan, but none of them lead to her.</li>
            <li>Uniformed officers, operational support, dog section, mounted section and underwater search and air support.</li>
            <li>Post mortem examination showed she wasn’t in the grave for nine months.</li>
            <li>There was no DNA from the murderer left on the body, so police had to follow a different approach.</li>
            <li>There was Dog DNA found on Tiernan. Samples were sent to a university in Texas that developed a DNA profiling technique for pedigreed animals.</li>
            <li>Police searched for anyone related to the Bramley area.</li>
            <li>There was a dog collar around her neck, and police contacted over 100 pet stores.</li>
            <li>One store had records of all the purchases and this lead to a man named John Taylor.</li>
            <li>Police found out that Taylor was a parcel employee and the cable ties found on Leanne were almost solely made by this company.</li>
            <li>Forensic scientists were then appointed to help prove that Leanne was at Taylor’s house.</li>
            <li>Pink carpet fiber found on Leanne’s jumper and the same pink carpet fibers were attached to a nail in Taylor’s house.</li>
            <li>Leanne’s blood was then found under Taylor’s floorboards.</li>
            <li>Found dog skull in garden.</li>
            <li>The hair found on Leanne failed DNA tests, so mitochondrial DNA was used to create a DNA profile from the small amounts found inside the hair shaft.</li>
            <li>Leanne’s blood was then found under Taylor’s floorboards.</li>
            <li>Found dog skull in garden.</li>
            <li>45 year old John Taylor was arrested on October 16th, 2001.</li>
            <li>Police blocked off his house and began a search.</li>
            <li>Dug up garden and found remains of 28 ferrets and four dogs.</li>
            <li>Tan leather collar found was produced by a company in Nottingham that sold their collars by wholesale.</li>
            <li>The green bin liners found around Tiernan’s body were found in Taylor’s house.</li>
            <li>Police questioned Taylor’s ex-girlfriends.</li>
            <li>They revealed that Taylor had a desire for tying up women.</li>
            <li>During the trial, Taylor only admitted to kidnapping Leanne and not killing her.</li>
            <li>Decomposition on the body proved that Leanne had not been buried for nine months.</li>
            <li>The judge concluded that the body was kept in Taylor’s freezer for some time before disposing of her body in the woods.</li>
            <li>On July 8th, 2002, Taylor pleaded guilty to abduction and murder.</li>
            <li>Sentenced to two counts of life imprisonment.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>First time dog DNA had been used in a British criminal case.</li>
            <li>Largest case West Yorkshire had ever worked.</li>
            <li>When the body was discovered by a man walking his dog, it had been reported that an elderly couple had seen Taylor dispose of the body just a few days earlier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. The Mayfield Affair (2004)</h2>
        <img src="/case4(3.1).png" alt="">
        <p>Attorney Brandon Mayfield was arrested by the FBI on the morning of 
            May 6, 2004 at his office near Portland, Oregon. He was arrested for 
            his suspected involvement in the March 11, 2004 bombing of four 
            commuter trains in Madrid, Spain that killed 191 people and injured 
            over 2,000 others.  Several senior fingerprint examiners from the FBI 
            made a “100 % positive identification” to Brandon Mayfield after 
            Spanish authorities recovered a partial print on a plastic bag that 
            contained the same detonating devices used in the bombings.   His 
            prints were in AFIS because he was in the military for 8 years before 
            being honorably discharged as a second lieutenant</p>
        <p>In the weeks before his arrest, Mayfield's family was under the impression that their house had been broken into 
            at least twice, although nothing was stolen. According to court documents, the FBI wire tapped his phones, bugged 
            his house, and searched his house several times.  
            Mayfield, age 37 and a Muslim convert, was initially held with no access to family and limited access, if any, to legal 
            counsel. The U.S. Attorney’‛s Office came up with a list of Mayfield’‛s potential ties to Muslim terrorists and also 
            said that while no travel records were found for Mayfield, “It is believed that Mayfield may have traveled under a 
            false or fictitious name.”  </p>
        <p>After Mayfield’‛s arrest, his wife Mona told reporters, “I think it’‛s crazy. We haven’‛t been outside the country for 
            10 years. They found only a part of one fingerprint. It could be anybody.” Her words in defense of her husband 
            were soon to prove prophetic. 
            On May 24, after the Spaniards had linked the print from the plastic bag to an Algerian national, Mayfield’‛s case 
            was thrown out. The FBI issued him a highly unusual official apology, and his ordeal became a stunning 
            embarrassment to the U.S. government.   He was awarded close to 2 million dollars by the US.   </p>
        <p>As was discovered during his court case, even the FBI's own records show that this fingerprint, despite the sworn 
            testimony of FBI and DOJ agents, was in all reality not an exact match but only one of 20 "similar" prints to the 
            ones retrieved from Madrid. Based on that list of people with "similar prints" the FBI launched an extensive 
            investigation of all 20 individuals. The investigation included medical records, financial records, employment 
            records, etc. on all 20 people and their families. It was during this time that Brandon Mayfield's name rose to the 
            top of the list.</p>
        <img src="/case4(3.2).png" alt="">
        <p>As part of its corrective action process, the FBI formed an 
            international committee of distinguished latent print examiners 
            and forensic experts. Their task was to review the analysis 
            performed by the FBI Laboratory and make recommendations that 
            would help prevent this type of error in the future. The committee 
            came up with some startling findings and observations.</p>
        <p>The committee members agreed that “the quality of the images 
            that were used to make the erroneous identification was not a 
            factor.  The identification is filled with dissimilarities that were 
            easily observed when a detailed analysis of the latent print was 
            conducted.” They further stated the power of the AFIS hit, 
            coupled with the pressure of working an extremely high profile 
            case, and probably influenced the initial examiner’‛s judgment and 
            examination.  The mind-set is that the 7 matching minutiae points that triggered the AFIS hit isn’‛t that far from 
            the accepted number of 12-13 matching points, the standard for a fingerprint to be considered a “match”.  </p>
        <p>Once the first examiner made the error, the follow-up examinations were also tainted because he had knowledge 
            of the previous examiner’‛s conclusions (especially since the initial examiner was a highly respected supervisor with 
            many years of experience). To disagree was not an expected response…. When the individualization had been made 
            by the examiner, it became increasingly difficult for others in the agency to disagree. </p>
        <p>The committee went on to make a number of quality assurance recommendations to help avoid a recurrence of this 
            type of error.  
            The impact of the Mayfield affair on fingerprint technology as currently practiced and the weight courts will 
            assign to fingerprint matches remain open questions.</p>
